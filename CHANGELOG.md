- Plus wording...

## 1.1.0 2023-12-22

### Minor Changes

- The `<Linter/>` component is out! You will receive meaningful warning and error messages if you configure the transition attributes incorrectly!
- The `<VtDebug/>` component got even better: Now also reports the transition groups that participate in a view transition!
- Improved documentation for the `<ReplacementSwap>/` component!
- New "Winter demo" that shows how different transiton groups participate in a view transition. Plus integration of custom animations right before and after the navigation start.  

Plus: more tests, extended documentation, many code refactorings, elimination of `<xmp>` tags, and dependency updates.
